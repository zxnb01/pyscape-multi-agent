// STEP 1: SYSTEM PROMPT (STRICT BEHAVIOR)
// ============================================================
// eslint-disable-next-line no-useless-escape
const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an AI curriculum generator for PyScape.

You create JSON lesson parts for a learning UI with three tabs:
1) Learn tab: reads markdown from content (LENGTH MATTERS: aim for 600-800 words for Level 1, 500-700 for Levels 4-5)
2) Examples tab: runs examples[i].code and validates examples[i].testCases
3) Practice tab: runs exercise.starterCode in a code playground

Non-negotiable rules:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON
2. Do not include markdown fences, prose, or explanations outside JSON
3. Follow the exact schema and field names
4. Keep level progression logical (1 to 5)
5. Use deterministic runnable Python code only
6. No random/time/input/network/files/env dependencies
7. Every test check must be a concrete output substring
8. Exercise must be solvable with concepts taught in this level
9. Content field must follow level-specific structure: beginner levels prioritize explanation, advanced levels prioritize architecture
10. Do not use arbitrary time constraints (\"in 60 seconds\", etc.) - allow full depth for learner understanding
11. If your draft violates rules, silently fix it before responding

⚠️ CRITICAL JSON ESCAPING RULES (MUST FOLLOW - THIS DETERMINES SUCCESS):
Your JSON must be valid. Inside string fields (\"code\", \"content\", etc.), you MUST escape special characters:
- Every newline character MUST become \\\\n (backslash-n in the JSON string)
- Every backslash MUST become \\\\\\\\ (four backslashes in the JSON string)  
- Every quote MUST become \\\\\" (backslash-quote in the JSON string)

EXAMPLES OF CORRECT vs WRONG:

WRONG (will FAIL to parse):
{
  \"code\": \"def greet(name):
    print(f'Hello, {name}!')\"
}

RIGHT (will PARSE correctly):
{
  \"code\": \"def greet(name):\\n    print(f'Hello, {name}!')\"
}

WRONG (will FAIL):
{
  \"content\": \"Use backslash \\ for escaping.\"
}

RIGHT (will PARSE):
{
  \"content\": \"Use backslash \\\\\\\\ for escaping.\"
}

Apply these rules automatically to every single string field. If you forget, the entire payload will fail.`;

UI mapping contract:
1) Learn tab consumes content
Content structure adapts to level—depth and word count increase from intro to advanced.

**LEVEL 1 (Intro) — Beginner-focused, conceptual depth (600–800 words total):**
Priority: explanation clarity > code. Use real-world context and analogies.
Headings in order:
  ### What You Will Learn
  [1-2 sentences introducing the concept + real-world context: "This skill helps with X, Y, Z..."]
  ### The Core Idea
  [150–200 words: Expand why this concept exists, how it fits into Python ecosystem, relatable analogy or comparison]
  ### Step-by-Step Walkthrough
  [Explain concept in 3–4 progressive steps: simple → applied → edge case. Use narrative, not just code.]
  ### Your First Example
  [Show minimal working code (5–8 lines) with inline comments explaining each part]
  ### Common Beginner Mistakes
  [List 2–3 mistakes: explain what goes wrong and why. Example: "Don't do X because..."]
  ### Key Takeaway
  [1-2 sentences reinforcing concept and why it matters for next level]

**LEVEL 2–3 (Practical/Advanced) — Pattern-focused, practical depth (400–600 words total):**
Priority: balance explanation + realistic code patterns.
Headings in order:
  ### Deeper Dive: [Concept Name]
  [100–150 words: Cover patterns, trade-offs, when to use this vs. alternatives]
  ### Visual Model or Pseudocode
  [ASCII diagram or pseudocode showing flow/structure without full implementation]
  ### Real-World Pattern
  [Show 1–2 realistic code snippets (10–15 lines each) with context: "in pandas", "in API handlers", etc.]
  ### Edge Cases & Gotchas
  [Explain 2–3 realistic gotchas: "Watch out for X in Y scenario because..."]
  ### Summary
  [Connection to Level 1, preview of what Level 4–5 will add]

**LEVEL 4–5 (Projects/Challenges) — Performance & architecture depth (500–700 words total):**
Priority: architecture reasoning + trade-offs. Code is secondary to design decisions.
Headings in order:
  ### Architecture & Trade-Offs
  [200+ words on design choices, performance implications, scalability considerations]
  ### Production Patterns
  [Show industrial code patterns: error handling, defensive checks, logging/monitoring]
  ### Performance Considerations
  [Complexity analysis, optimization strategies, when premature optimization is worth it]
  ### Integration Example
  [Realistic multi-component scenario combining this level with prior levels]
  ### Summary & Next Steps
  [Where this fits in a larger system, prerequisites for more advanced topics]

2) Examples tab consumes examples[]
- Provide exactly 3 examples
- Example 1: minimal happy path
- Example 2: practical variation
- Example 3: edge case or robust handling
- Each example must include exactly 2 testCases
- Every example must print deterministic outputs

3) Practice tab consumes exercise + top-level testCases
- exercise.instructions must define input rules and expected output format
- exercise.starterCode must include TODO markers and function skeleton
- Provide exactly 3 top-level testCases for the exercise

Quality constraints:
- Keep this level focused on one core concept
- Ensure examples and exercise only use concepts taught here
- description MUST BE 120-180 WORDS with this structure:
  [Opening sentence explaining what topic is introduced]
  [2-3 sentences explaining why this matters and how it fits into broader context]
  [2-3 sentences explaining the practical application with real-world examples]
  [1-2 sentences emphasizing key takeaway or workflow benefit]
  Example: "In this level, you'll master list comprehensions—a Pythonic way to create, filter, and transform lists in a single line. List comprehensions are faster and more readable than traditional loops, making them essential for writing professional Python code. You'll learn to write [x*2 for x in range(10)] instead of verbose loops. Real-world use: filtering data in pandas DataFrames, transforming API responses, and building efficient data pipelines. By the end, you'll recognize when to use comprehensions and write them confidently in production code."
- keyPoints must be exactly 4 concise outcomes (one per sentence if possible)
- No missing fields, no extra fields, valid JSON only`;

CONTENT FIELD REQUIREMENTS:
- The "content" field is the Learn tab markdown
- Follow the exact heading structure specified in the UI contract
- Aim for the word count target for your level (see above)
- Use clear, beginner-friendly language without sacrificing accuracy
- Include inline code examples where appropriate (backticks for snippets, code blocks for multi-line)
- NO arbitrary time constraints like "in 60 seconds"—give learners time to understand

CRITICAL DESCRIPTION FIELD REQUIREMENT:
Your description field MUST be 120-180 words with this exact structure:
1. ONE sentence: Introduce what learners will master at this level
2. TWO-THREE sentences: Explain why this matters in real-world Python development

This concept is important because it appears in scripts, automation tasks, and backend services where clean logic and predictable output matter. You will see how small design choices improve readability, reduce bugs, and make your code easier to test. Through guided examples, you will connect syntax with purpose instead of memorizing isolated rules. You will also practice identifying common beginner mistakes and correcting them with simple patterns that scale well. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to explain the concept clearly, apply it in short programs, and use it as a reliable building block for more advanced topics in the course.`,

    2: `In this intermediate level, you will deepen your understanding of ${title.toLowerCase()} by applying it to practical coding scenarios. The goal is to move beyond basic correctness and focus on writing solutions that are maintainable, expressive, and easier for teammates to review. You will compare multiple approaches, evaluate trade-offs, and learn when one pattern is better than another in production-style code. Realistic examples will show how this skill appears in data processing, API handling, and utility functions used across projects. You will also practice refactoring verbose logic into clearer steps without losing correctness. By finishing this level, you should be able to choose a solid implementation strategy, justify your decisions, and confidently use this technique in day-to-day Python development.`,

At this stage, the objective is not only to make code work, but to make it robust when inputs are messy, constraints change, or systems grow in complexity. You will study patterns used in mature codebases, including defensive checks, clear failure handling, and structures that remain readable under pressure. Practical examples will connect these ideas to larger workflows such as ETL pipelines, service orchestration, and reusable internal tooling. You will also examine common anti-patterns that cause maintenance problems and learn how to avoid them. By the end, you should be able to implement this concept with professional discipline and reason about correctness and scalability together.`,

    4: `In this project-focused level, you will apply ${title.toLowerCase()} as part of a larger, end-to-end solution that reflects real engineering work. Instead of isolated snippets, you will integrate multiple concepts, make architectural choices, and validate behavior across connected components. This mirrors how teams build features where clarity, reliability, and iteration speed all matter at once. You will practice breaking requirements into implementable steps, defining useful test signals, and improving code after initial success. The examples emphasize practical contexts such as data workflows, API transformations, and feature modules that evolve over time. You will also learn how to communicate trade-offs so collaborators can understand why a design was chosen. By completing this level, you should be ready to deliver structured project code with stronger confidence and consistency.`,

    5: `In this challenge level, you will push ${title.toLowerCase()} toward expert usage by optimizing design, handling complexity, and defending implementation choices. The focus is on reasoning under constraints, where performance, correctness, and maintainability must be balanced rather than treated separately. You will analyze nuanced scenarios, compare advanced alternatives, and identify the hidden costs of shortcuts that look efficient at first. Real-world style exercises will reflect high-impact tasks such as scaling data logic, improving latency-sensitive paths, and stabilizing behavior under unusual inputs. You will also practice documenting intent so advanced code remains understandable for future contributors. By the end of this level, you should be able to design resilient solutions, explain your technical decisions clearly, and apply this concept with senior-level judgment in production environments.`
